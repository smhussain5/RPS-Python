# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS PYTHON

![RPS Python GIF Demonstration](https://github.com/smhussain5/RPS-Python/blob/main/RPS_PYTHON.gif?raw=true)

## Problem ðŸ¤”

Fundamentals in Python are extremely important and require practice; however, practice should not be boring. The best way is to develop your own projects regardless of how "simple" it may seem.

## Solution ðŸ’¡

This terminal application utilizes user input to create an interactive experience. The Random module allows the CPU to make its own move. Both choices are stored in a tuple that is compared with winning tuples to determine the winner. This game logic is wrapped within a while loop that allows for players to play the game again if they would like.

## Technologies Used âš™

- PyCharm 
- Python
  - If/Elif/Else statement
  - "In" operator
  - Input
  - "Random" module
  - Tuples
  - While loop

## Challenges ðŸ’¢

This was a straightforward application, but required proper organization for clean code. Fortunately, PEP8 guidelines built into PyCharm allows developers to follow best practices easily!

## Insights ðŸ’­

This project was great practice for conditionals like while loops and if/else statements. It was also great to follow PEP8 guidelines for better code readibility.
